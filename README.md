# VaporOS Buster

Valve hasn't released SteamOS based on Buster yet, so here is a test to see if it can be done without their help.

## Currently implemented features

Currently the following features have been implemented:

- An ISO can be genereated with gen.sh
- Firmware files are included on the disk

## Deviations from SteamOS

These are deviations from SteamOS which have been made on purpose:

 - The amdgpu-pro-firmware package hasn't been included yet. It isn't available in the Debian repository.

These deviations may change in the future, depending on the reason behind them. Assume all other differences from SteamOS haven't been looked into yet or are still being worked on.
